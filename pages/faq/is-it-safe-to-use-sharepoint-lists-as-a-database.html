  <h2>FAQ — Is it safe to use SharePoint lists as a database?</h2>

  <div class="faq-content">
    <h3>Short Answer</h3>
    <p class="faq-lead">
      SharePoint lists are not databases. At scale, structured data should live in SQL, Dataverse, or other relational systems.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Issues</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Performance degradation with thousands of items</li>
      <li>Limited query and aggregation capabilities</li>
      <li>Workflow and automation throttling</li>
      <li>High maintenance and risk of data loss</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recommended Approach</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Keep documents and metadata in SharePoint.</li>
      <li>Move structured data to relational systems for large-scale operations.</li>
      <li>Use APIs to connect SharePoint UI with external databases.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Final Answer</h3>
    <p class="faq-conclusion">
      SharePoint lists are great for collaboration, but they are not a replacement for a database at scale.
    </p>

      “Lists store collaboration data; databases store structured data. Mixing them without architecture planning creates risk.”
