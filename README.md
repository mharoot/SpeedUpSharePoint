# ada-widget
This branch does not yet have the follow for the ada widget:

## ADHD Friendly
Doesn’t seem to do anything.  It needs to darken the entire web page like an overlay, and have a 175px height section that follows the mouse around, that shows an entire width of the html page without the overlay on it, so reader can focus.

This profile significantly reduces distractions, to help people with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders browse, read, and focus on the essential elements of the website more easily.


## Keyboard Navigation 
is not there.
